# Building Type Classifier
Through my attempts to learn about Machine Learning and Deep Learning, this is a simple classifier to classify images of residential and industrial areas accordingly. This was, in fact, a challenge from the Udacity Bertelsmann Deep Learning scholarship. The Kaggle competition link can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/building-type).

Both models and Notebooks used the PyTorch framework.

## Models
In this repo, there are two notebooks: one pertraining to transfer learning and another with an CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). The accuracy of both, as it's shown in the following table, are almost identical.

Model | Overall Accuracy     | Residential Accuracy   | Industrial Accuracy  |
:-------------: | :-------------: |:-------------:| :-------------:|
ResNet | 92% | 97% | 87% |
Own CNN | 91% | 90%  | 92%  |
